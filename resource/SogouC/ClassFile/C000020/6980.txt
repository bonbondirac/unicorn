　　Nearly half of Japan's housewives keep money secret from their husbands and 
most of them doubt their spouses have any idea about it, a survey found, showing 
women's hold the purse strings here.
　　About 46 percent of housewives said they had secret funds, with the sum 
averaging 2.41 million yen (20,000 dollars), according to a survey of 500 wives 
in salary-earning households by Sompo Japan DIY Life Insurance.
　　The hidden savings seem to be accumulating with time, as the average sum 
was four million yen for housewives in their 50s, nearly three times as much as 
the 1.46 million yen for those in their 20s.
　　On the other hand, 76 percent of the women believe their husbands keep no 
such secret money. Even those who suspect their husbands have funds they don't 
know about estimate the sum at a modest 364,000 yen.
　　"After all, most wives believe their husbands have no secret assets and 
they have a grip on their family purse strings," the life insurer said.
　　日本最新的一项调查显示，将近一半的日本家庭主妇背着丈夫存有私房钱，而她们中的大部分人都相信丈夫可能对此毫不知情。
　　据法新社2月21日报道，日本财产保险公司针对500名工薪阶层家庭主妇做了一项调查。结果显示，46％的被调查者透露有自己的秘密小金库，且小金库的平均金额为241万日元（约合2万美元）。
　　调查显示，日本主妇的私房钱大都是长年累月积攒下来的，20几岁年龄段主妇的私房钱平均为146万日元，而50岁左右年龄段的主妇为400万日元，大约是前者的3倍。
　　有趣的是，当大部分主妇确信丈夫对她们的小金库一无所知时，76％的主妇认为她们的丈夫没有存私房钱。而即使那些怀疑丈夫有私房钱的主妇也估计那些钱的总数大约为36.4万日元。
　　保险公司人员指出：“总之，大部分家庭主妇相信丈夫没有私人小金库，因为她们牢牢掌握了家里的财政大权。”
