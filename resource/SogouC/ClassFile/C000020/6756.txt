　　Hollywood star Harrison Ford might be getting on in years, but he still has 
oodles of appeal.
　　Hundreds of screaming fans greeted the 63-year-old sex symbol at the 
Australian premiere of his latest blockbuster, Firewall, in Sydney last 
night.
　　Ford and his fiancee of four years, former Ally McBeal star Calista 
Flockhart, 41, dazzled the crowd at Bondi Junction.
　　Ford said he was happy to be back in Australia for the first time in 12 
years.
　　"It's been a while. It's good to be back," he said.
　　Flockhart said the star couple and her adopted five-year-old son Liam spent 
much of the day at Taronga Park Zoo. "We had a little walk around," she said. 
"We went to the zoo and it was wonderful."
　　The trio arrived in Australia yesterday aboard a private jet.
　　In Firewall, a crime thriller, Ford plays Jack Stanfield -- a husband, 
father and head of security for a global bank who is forced to hack into the 
business to pay a $135 million ransom to free his kidnapped family.
　　Asked why he had been attracted to the role, Ford said: "I like to play a 
real person who has a real life and family.
　　"I just thought it would be a good movie for an audience to enjoy."
　　Ford has at least three new projects on the horizon -- the sci-fi thriller 
Godspeed, Manhunt, about US president Abraham Lincoln's assassin, and Indiana 
Jones 4.
