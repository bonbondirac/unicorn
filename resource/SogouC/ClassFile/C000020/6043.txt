university, i will concentrate on the study and reserch in this field. first i 
will hard to learn the theoritical knowledge,constucting a solid base for my 
future work； second i would like to do some practical work with the help of the 
supervisor ang classmate .and through this ,i can get something that cannot be 
acquired from the textooks. i believe after 2 years of learning ,my dream will 
finally come true……
　　First of all, I love my major. Chinese literature is the symbol of the 
start of Chinese literary modernization. It plays an important part in 
modernization of our citizens'thoughts. What's more, modern literature is very 
close to our daily life and it can deeply reflect the styles and features of our 
society. I am fascinated by the great masters refreshing or warm or profound 
styles as well. But I am not easily satisfied with such superficial knowledge. I 
hope I could have a better understanding in modern literature by studying 
further. This is a very important reason for me to take the postgraduate 
exams.
　　Next, I love the feeling in the university. It is full of youthful spirit. 
And I am deeply attracted by the scholarly atmosphere. And the most important, 
it's my great honor to open my ears to your teaching.
　　Finally, I want to talk about a very practical problem. That is my dream of 
becoming a teacher in the university. I want to realize my dream and make myself 
to be a well-qualified person. I think the postgraduate studies can enrich my 
knowledge and make me competent in my future job.
　　That's my simple and clear reasons why I took the postgraduate exams.
