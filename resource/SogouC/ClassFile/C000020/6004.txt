Nude volunteers prepare to pose for a photograph by American 
artist Spencer Tunick, not seen, at sunrise on Ave. Bolivar in downtown Caracas, 
Venezuela, Sunday, March 19, 2006. Tunick has photographed and filmed masses of 
people in the nude in dozens of public places from Finland to Australia. 

More than 1,500 people gathered around a statue of 19th century liberation 
hero Simon Bolivar on Sunday and posed nude for a U.S. artist famous for his photos 
of naked crowds in public spaces.&nbsp; 
Spencer Tunick organized the Caracas photo shoot along downtown Avenida 
Bolivar, a frequent spot for political 
rallies by supporters of President Hugo Chavez. 
Surrounded by dozens of reporters and onlookers, the participants cracked 
jokes, shouted cheers for Tunick and struck poses for the press. 
"I worked very, very hard and the people were extremely, extremely, extremely 
exuberant," Tunick said after the shoot. 
"It's a new experience. And beyond the disinhibition of taking off clothes, this also 
involves art," said Jerry Lino, 30, who took part in the event. "One never feels 
naked." 
More than 7,800 people had signed up, but only some 1,500 showed up. 

Tunick has photographed nude people in New York City as well as other urban 
centers around the world including London, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Vienna, 
Austria.

上周日，1500多名群众聚集在19世纪民族解放英雄西蒙・玻利瓦尔的雕像前。他们赤身裸体摆着姿势，供一位美国著名街头人体摄影师拍照。 
斯潘塞・图尼奇组织的这次裸体摄影在加拉卡斯市中心的波利华大道举行，这里是总统乌戈・查韦斯的支持者们常常举行政治集会的地方。 
面对众多的围观记者和群众，参与者谈笑自如，不时地向图尼奇欢呼，并且摆出姿势让媒体拍照。 
图尼奇在拍完照片后说：“我拍得非常、非常认真，模特们也非常、非常热情。” 
“这是一次全新的体验。脱掉衣服并不仅仅为了释放内心的压抑，同时还是艺术，”30岁的杰里・利诺参加了本次活动，他说：“参与者根本没感到自己赤身裸体。” 
之前，7800多人报名参加此次裸体摄影，而实际参与者只有1500人左右。图尼奇曾在世界其它大城市举办过类似群裸摄影，如纽约、伦敦、巴西的圣保罗、和奥地利的维也纳。
