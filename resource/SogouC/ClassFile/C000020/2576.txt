　　Beijing to improve English signs on major roads
　　Measures to ensure foreigners in Beijing do not get "lost" are being taken, 
the Foreign Affairs Office of Beijing Municipality said yesterday.
　　It expects to improve signs written in English on all the major roads 
within the Sixth Ring Road and shopping malls by the end of this year.
　　The capital city currently has 650,000 people from overseas working and 
living in Beijing.
　　The figure is set to swell even further in the run-up to the 2008 
Olympics.
　　The signs correction group, supported by a linguist team, will unveil 
correction plans for signs within the Third Ring Road today.
　　Meanwhile, by 2008, more Beijing residents than ever before will be able to 
speak English well enough to help foreigners who ask for assistance.
　　Checking and correction work for the fourth, fifth and sixth ring roads 
have already started, said Yang Liuyin, director of the office.
　　Chen Lin, an English language expert, said: "Creating a sound and smooth 
language environment is the basic need for anyone."
　　A drive to promote residents' English oral skills to help build up the 
city's international image was launched three years ago.
　　By the end of 2005, 29 out of every 100 Beijingers could speak at least 
basic English, or 4.45 million people, according to the foreign affairs 
office.
　　The figure is expected to increase to 35 per cent by 2008 when the Olympic 
Games begin, said Yang.
　　A mass language learning programme has been created covering all ages, via 
TV shows, "English corners" and regional oral and writing competitions.
　　More than 150,000 people have taken part in hundreds of non-profit public 
lectures on foreign language and culture learning and etiquette studies.
　　The lectures received generous contributions from the country's top 
language training institutes.
