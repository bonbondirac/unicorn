　　A wave of international victories for Dutch darts players has prompted an 
increase in the number of injuries as people take up the game at home, according 
to the Dutch consumer safety association.
　　Over-eagerness caused some of the most injuries, said a spokeswoman for the 
group, with players hurling their darts before opponents had finished retrieving 
their own.
　　Poorly hung dartboards also posed problems. "Often the board falls down on 
someone's foot or worse on someone's head," she added.
　　About 120 people are admitted to hospitals each year with injuries 
sustained during darts, with pierced fingers and wrists most common. Eye 
injuries were rare, the association said.
　　"Maybe it is national pride that when one of us is good at a sport, we all 
want a go," the spokeswoman said.
　　Last month 21-year-old Dutchman Jelle Klaasen wowed audiences at the World 
Darts championship, with a victory over fellow Dutchman Raymond van Barneveld, 
to become the youngest ever world champion and a national hero.
　　荷兰消费者安全协会近日表示，由于该国飞镖运动员近期在一系列国际比赛中取得胜利，所以越来越多的荷兰人开始热衷于在自己家中参与这项运动，但由此而引发的人身伤害事件也正呈日益增加之势。
　　据路透社2月21日报道，该协会的一位女发言人说，导致大部分此类事件发生的原因之一是，某些参与者在游戏过程中往往表现得心太急，他们总是在对手尚未将已掷出的镖拔下来之前便急匆匆地投出自己的镖。而飞镖盘悬挂不稳则是造成人身伤害的另一个原因。该女发言人说：“飞镖盘经常会砸到一个人的脚上，但有时也会出现更糟的情况，那就是掉到一个人的头上。”
　　据统计，荷兰每年约有120人因玩飞镖而受伤，最为常见的伤情是手指和手腕被刺破，眼睛受伤的情况十分罕见。
　　现年21岁的荷兰人耶勒・克拉森在上个月举行的世界飞镖锦标赛中技惊四座，他最终战胜了同胞范巴内维尔德，成为有史以来最年轻的飞镖世界冠军，并由此被视为荷兰的民族英雄。
