　　"I get the sense that people no longer respect the dead. It's disturbing," 
a funeral director told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper.
　　At one ceremony several people gathered round the coffin and took out their 
phones to photograph the corpse as preparations were made to begin a cremation, 
she was quoted as saying.
　　"I'm sure the deceased would never want their faces photographed," she 
said. But others called it a form of a memento in the modern age.
　　"Some can't grasp 'reality' unless they take a photo and share it with 
others ... It comes from a desire to keep a strong bond with the deceased," 
social commentator Toru Takeda told the paper.
　　众所周知，日本人喜欢拍照。但其他国家的人可能没想到，他们会把这种兴趣发挥得淋漓尽致――在葬礼上拍下已故者的遗容。
　　据路透社2月16日报道，日本一名葬礼承办人说，如今，日本人的葬礼上通常都会出现这样的一幕：一群人围着灵柩，对着即将被火化的遗体，按动着手中照相机的快门。承办人说：“我感觉，人们不再尊重死者。我确信，死者一定不愿意他们的脸被拍下来。”。
　　但有日本人表示，为死者拍照是现代人纪念死者的一种方式。日本社会评论员Toru 
Takeda指出，一些人不能面对失去他人的痛苦，所以要用照片来记录这个事实……这是一种想留住死者的强烈愿望所致。”
