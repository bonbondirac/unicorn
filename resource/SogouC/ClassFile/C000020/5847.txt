The 150-cut monster measured 55 inches by 37 inches. It took 
10.03 pounds of cheese, 14.97 pounds of dough, 8.26 pounds of sauce to contruct, 
and 20 minutes to bake. The 'Big One' costs $99.99 with one topping. 

A pizzeria named Mama Lena's Pizza House in Pennsylvania is vying for a spot in Guinness World Records for the 
world's largest commercially available pizza. The $99, 150-slice pizza isn't a 
one-time deal. In fact, The Big One is already available, though the pizzeria 
has had few takers so far. The would-be recordsetter measures about 3 
feet by 4 1/2 feet and takes up nearly all the space in the shop's brick oven. 
The current record holder is a 4-foot diameter pizza offered by Paul Revere's 
Pizza in Iowa. Dubbed the Ultimate Party Pizza, it uses more than 10 pounds of 
dough, 48 ounces of sauce and about five pounds of cheese. 
The Big One takes about 15 minutes to prepare and another 20 to 25 minutes to 
bake, said Rob Carrabbia, whose wife, Wendy, owns the pizzeria in suburban 
Pittsburgh. 
"The only way you're looking to order it is if you want a big pizza," 
Carrabbia said. 
Mama Lena's was already offering a 30-inch by 30-inch, 64-slice pizza when 
Carrabbia read about the current record holder in a trade magazine and figured 
he could beat it. 
The pizza has been on the menu for more than a year. So far, about 10 have 
been sold, including for birthday parties and to a school for its basketball 
team. 
Carrabbia said Guinness requires that the pizza's making be videotaped and 
witnessed by a public official. 
Besides the novelty, Carrabbia said anyone who orders The Big One is getting 
a bargain. 
"It's less than a dollar a slice" for a plain cheese pizza , he 
said. Toppings are extra and a white pizza - no red sauce, but garlic, cheese 
and marinated tomatoes - costs $120.99. 
The category is different from the world's largest pizza. That record was set 
in 1990 in South Africa, where Norwood Hypermarket made a pizza 122 feet, eight 
inches in diameter, using 9,920 pounds of flour, 3,968 pounds of cheese and 
1,984 pounds of sauce. 
For its 50th anniversary in 1994, Guinness named that pizza one of its top 10 
most astounding feats.

宾夕法尼亚州一家名为“莉娜妈妈”的比萨饼店正在角逐世界上最大的“可售”比萨饼吉尼斯世界纪录。这块价值99美元、可切分为150小块的比萨一下子可卖不完。虽然到目前为止，没有几个人点这款大比萨，但事实上顾客们已经能在店里定制到这款“巨无霸”了。 

这款即将创下吉尼斯世界纪录的比萨宽3英尺、长4.5英尺，几乎占据了比萨店砖砌烤炉的全部空间。 
目前的吉尼斯纪录保持者是由爱荷华州保尔・里维尔比萨店制作的一块直径达4英尺的比萨。这块比萨由10磅生面、48盎司酱和约5磅的奶酪制作而成，被授予“世界上最大的宴会比萨”称号。 

罗布・卡拉比亚说：“制作‘巨无霸比萨’的准备工作用了15分钟，之后的烘烤用了20至25分钟。”罗布的妻子温蒂是这家位于匹兹堡（宾州西南部城市）郊区的比萨店的主人。 

卡拉比亚说：“能点‘巨无霸比萨’的理由只有一个，就是你确实需要买一个这么大的比萨饼”。 
卡拉比亚从一本行业杂志上了解到目前的吉尼斯世界纪录时，“莉娜妈妈”店已经有长宽为30英寸、可切为64块的比萨饼可卖了，所以，卡拉比亚觉得破纪录没有问题。 
“莉娜妈妈”提供这款这款比萨饼已经有一年多了。到目前为止，已售出10只，其中包括生日聚会和一所学校的篮球队所定制的。 
卡拉比亚说吉尼斯要求录制比萨饼的制作过程，还要求有官员在现场做见证人。 
卡拉比亚说，定制巨无霸比萨饼的顾客除了能尝到新鲜，还能得到实惠。 
他说：“一小块原味奶酪比萨售价不到1美元”。上面的浇头另算。一张白比萨（不加红酱，由大蒜、奶酪和腌制西红柿制成的浇头）售价为120.99美元。 
巨无霸比萨饼和世界上最大的比萨饼有所不同。世界上最大的比萨饼纪录于1990年诞生于南非，当时诺伍德大超市制作了一个周长为122英尺，直径为8英寸的比萨饼，用料9920磅面粉、3968磅奶酪和1984磅酱料。 

1994年，吉尼斯在50周年纪念，评选出“十大最惊人技艺”，这款比萨饼名列其中。&nbsp;
