　　热爱生活的人，即使狂风暴雨，也能看到彩虹，他们相信“阳光总在风雨后”；抱怨生活的人，即使阳光普照，也会紧琐双眉，他们觉得阳光刺疼了眼睛。其实，生活不在别处，就在你的心里。美国作家亨利・大卫・梭罗的这篇《Love 
your Life》道出生活真谛：能处处寻找快乐的人才是最富有的。
　　However mean your life is, meet it and live it; do not shun it and call it 
hard names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you are richest. 
The fault-finder will find faults in paradise. Love your life, poor as it 
is.
　　You may perhaps have some pleasant, thrilling, glorious hours even in a 
poor-house. The setting sun is reflected from the windows of the alms-house as 
brightly as from the rich man's abode; the snow melts before its door as early 
in the spring. I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there, and 
have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace.
　　The town's poor seem to me often to live the most independent lives of any. 
Maybe they are simply great enough to receive without misgiving. Most think that 
they are above being supported by the town; but it often happens that they are 
not above supporting themselves by dishonest means which should be more 
disreputable.
　　Cultivate poverty like a garden herb, like sage. Do not trouble yourself 
much to get new things, whether clothes or friends, Turn the old, return to 
them. Things do not change; we change. Sell your clothes and keep your 
thoughts.
