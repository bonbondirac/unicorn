　　人人都知道奥运会有个比赛项目叫马拉松。它起源于历史事件，但它可是现代奥运才有的项目。
　　The marathon was never one of the ancient Olympic events, although its 
origin dates back to another episode in ancient Greek history.
　　The traditional origin of the marathon comes from the story how a herald 
named Phidippides ran the 26 miles from Marathon to Athens to announce the Greek 
victory and died on the spot.
　　In the 5th century B.C., the Persians invaded Greece, landing at Marathon, 
a small town about 26 miles from the city of Athens. Phidippides was sent by the 
Athenians to Sparta to ask for help; a man named Eukles announced the victory to 
the Athenians and then died.
　　Later sources confused the story of Phidippides with that of Eukles. 
Although most ancient authors do not support this legend, the story has 
persisted and is the basis for the modern-day marathon.
　　The modern Olympic marathon is approximately 26 miles and usually takes 
over 2 hours for athletes to finish.
