　　French 'spider-man' climbs 31-story tower
　　French skyscraper climber Alain Robert scaled a 31-floor office building 
outside Paris on Wednesday using only his bare hands, his last climb before 
spending a week in prison in Texas.
　　Robert was arrested in Houston in November on charges of trespassing and 
drug possession as he was about to climb the 46-floor One Houston Center. Police 
said they believed Robert was carrying the sedative Xanax, while the climber 
says it was a prescription anti-epilepsy medication.
　　Robert said his effort Wednesday was a protest against the court decision 
ordering him to serve prison time.
　　"I don't really understand why they are charging me with criminal trespass, 
as I didn't even climb," Robert said before ascending the 400-foot Mercurial 
Tower in the suburb of Bagnolet. He wore a skintight black and yellow outfit 
covered with advertisements.
　　Robert has climbed more than 70 of the world's tallest structures, 
including the Eiffel Tower, the Empire State Building and the Petronas Towers in 
Kuala Lumpur, with his bare hands and without a safety net.
　　本周三，法国摩天大楼攀登高手阿兰・罗伯特徒手爬上位于巴黎近郊的一幢31层的办公大楼。之后，他要去美国德克萨斯服刑一个星期。
　　罗伯特于去年11月因被指控携带违禁药物和非法侵入罪在休斯顿被捕，当时他正准备攀登46层的“休斯顿第一大楼”。警方说他们认为罗伯特携带了Xanax镇静剂，而罗伯特却说那仅仅是治疗癫痫病的药物。
　　罗伯特说他周三在巴黎爬楼的目的是抗议法庭做出让他服刑的判决。
　　在攀登这幢位于Bagnolet郊区高达400英尺的水银大楼之前，他说：“我实在是不理解他们为什么还以侵入罪指控我。因为那时我并没有爬楼。”罗伯特身穿黄黑相间的紧身外衣，上面印有广告。
　　罗伯特曾征服过70幢世界最高建筑，其中包括艾菲尔铁塔，帝国大厦和吉隆坡的双子楼。而他从来都是不系安全带，徒手攀登。
