　　Headaches may be an age old bedtime excuse for wives, but women really are 
more prone to pounding heads according to a new study.
　　Women were three times more likely to see their GP about headache symptoms 
compared with men, researchers found.
　　And while women aged 45 to 54 were more likely to be prescribed headaches 
pills than men of the same age, women aged 15 to 24 were those most likely to 
seek help from their doctor for the problem.
　　Common causes of headaches are stress, poor posture, bright sunlight and 
foods such as cheese and red wine.
　　They are one of the top 10 reasons people visit their doctors and account 
for one fifth of sick days from work.
　　The team from King's College London, studied nine years' worth of 
consultations and referrals to specialists up to the year 2000 at 253 general 
practices in the UK.
　　They found 6.4 per cent of consultations were for headaches for women, 
compared with 2.5 per cent for men.
　　Dr Martin Gulliford, from the Division of Health and Social Care at King's 
College said: "Patterns of treatment clearly differ between men and women. 
Prescribing rates for headache are relatively high for women of middle age.
　　"While women are more likely to be prescribed medication to prevent future 
attacks of headache, men are more likely to be referred to a specialist for 
investigation."
　　英国医学家最新公布的一项研究成果显示，女性比男性更容易患上头痛病。
　　据英国《每日邮报》2月16日报道，在过去的9年里，来自伦敦国王学院的一个研究小组对253例普通病例进行调查后发现，6.4％的病例为女性头痛，而男性头痛的病例为2.5％，这意味着女性犯头痛病的几率约是男性的3倍。
　　国王学院健康与社会保健部门的马丁・古里福德指出：“对于头痛的治疗，男性和女性完全不同。女性通常都靠服用药物来阻止头痛病的发作，其中中年妇女更是如此。然而，男性更愿意向专家探讨头痛的病因。”调查显示，与同龄男性相比，年龄在45岁至54岁的女性更喜欢服用药物来克服头痛，而15岁至24岁的女性则多愿意向医生寻求帮助解决头痛问题。
　　什么是导致头疼的原因？常见的原因包括压力、不正确的姿势、耀眼的阳光以及干酪和红酒等饮食。
　　调查表明，头痛是人们就诊的10大病症之一，也是占职员请病假理由的五分之一。这项研究已刊登在英国最新一期的《神经病学、神经外科学与精神病学》杂志上。
